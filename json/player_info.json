In July 2024, he scored for his nation in the European Championship final versus Spain.Ahead of the start of the 2024/25 campaign, there was good news for Chelsea fans when Palmer signed a two-year contract extension, committing him to the club until 2033. Very soon after he was one of the nominees for the prestigious Ballon dâ€™Or and he was ranked 25th for that award when the vote result was announced."
