                  A young attacking player of outstanding all-round quality who can create and score goals, his first year at Stamford Bridge could hardly have gone better as he was awarded Player of the Season and became a full England international. In July 2024, he scored for his nation in the European Championship final versus Spain.

                <p>
                  Ahead of the start of the 2024/25 campaign, there was good news for Chelsea fans when Palmer signed a two-year contract extension, committing him to the club until 2033. Very soon after he was one of the nominees for the prestigious Ballon dâ€™Or and he was ranked 25th for that award when the vote result was announced.

                    Palmer made his Chelsea debut coming on as a substitute at home to Nottingham Forest, one day after his signing. His first start came in his fourth appearance, a Carabao Cup win over Brighton in which he provided the assist for the only goal, with his own first Chelsea goal coming two games later when he converted a penalty. That was in a 4-1 win at Burnley in October 2023.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Having quickly become a surefire name on the team sheet and the first-choice penalty taker, Palmer's first four goals came from the spot, including a stoppage-time equaliser against his former club Man City, the day before he received his first call-up into the England senior squad. He registered four assists over the same period.

                    Open-play goals followed during his outstanding start at his new club, and his second in a win at Luton, a marvellously adept skip past the goalkeeper and finish, was voted Chelsea's Goal of the Month for December and was nominated for the equivalent Premier League award. Palmer was also on the shortlist for the Premier Leagueâ€™s Player of the Month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Two goals in a big win against Middlesbrough in the semi-final second leg earned him the Carabao Cup's Player of the Round.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Palmer's remarkable first Chelsea campaign accelerated still further when in March and April he scored 11 goals in just six games, including a hat-trick with two at the death against Man United to turn looming defeat into victory, and four past Everton including a first-half hat-trick. The first goal that day won a Premier League Goal of the Month award, and he was also named Premier League Player of the Season for April, the first Chelsea recipient since Eden Hazard in 2018, and the second youngest after Arjen Robben.

                  <p>
                    Honour followed honour followed honour - as at the Chelsea Annual Awards night Palmer picked up the Chelsea Player of the Year voted for by the fans, as well as the Players' Player of the Year Award. He was named the Premier Leagueâ€™s Young Player of the Season and the PFA Premier League Fansâ€™ Player of the Year. He later collected the PFA Young Player of the Year for the season.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the seasonâ€™s end, his 45 Chelsea games had served up 25 goals, 22 of them in the Premier League which was bettered only by Man Cityâ€™s Erling Haaland with 27. His 11 assists was the second-highest tally too, behind Villaâ€™s Ollie Watkins on 13.

                      Palmer joined Manchester Cityâ€™s academy at Under-8 level and moved through the youth ranks at the club. He captained Cityâ€™s Under-18s during the 2019/20 season and helped the side win the FA Youth Cup, scoring in the final against Chelsea.

                      In 2022/23, the 21-year-old established himself as a regular in the City squad. He made 25 appearances across all competitions and ended the campaign as a Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup winner.

                      In November of the same season, Palmer was a late call-up to the England senior squad for European Championship qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia, reward for a fine start to his Chelsea career.

                    <p>
                      He came on in the second half of the Malta match at Wembley to earn his first cap. England won 2-0.

                      On his third appearance, against Bosnia in June 2024, he slotted his first senior international goal. Following a season in which he scored nine out of nine penalties for Chelsea, it came from the spot. That was in a warm-up game for Euro 2024, with Palmer named in the squad for the tournament in Germany.

                      Having remained on the bench for the first two group-stage games, Palmer came on in all the matches that followed as England made the final and he had a big impact late in the tournament.

                    <p>
                      He converted a penalty when the quarter-final against Switzerland went to a shoot-out and he provided an incisive pass for Ollie Watkins to score a late winner against the Netherlands in the next match.

                    <p>
                      With England 1-0 down versus Spain in Berlin, Palmer supplied the type of goal Chelsea fans had enjoyed all season to level the scores in the final, although he would ultimately be on the losing side.
